# Introduction

As part of my greater effort to branch out of purely bioinformatics-centered R analyses, I took it upon myself to experiment with producing meaningful visualizations on other topics that I am passionate about. To that end, I sought to investigate cyclist collision statistics and examine part of the cost of underfunded bicycle infrastructure.

[According to the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia, as of 2017, approximately 17,000 workers bike to work, which represents 2.6% of all workers.](https://bicyclecoalition.org/us-census-biking-to-work-gets-a-bump-in-philly/#:~:text=The%20latest%20ACS%20release%20showed,who%20live%20in%20the%20City.) Despite this, bicycle infrastructure remains woefully inadequate to meet the needs of commuters and presents a significant obstacle to creating safer roads and reducing carbon emissions. Based on my own experiences, biking in Philly can be treacherous and I have, myself, put myself in harm's way to travel around the city.

Using data sourced from [PennDOT's GIS Open Data Portal](https://crashinfo.penndot.gov/PCIT/welcome.html), I wanted to examine when and where cyclist collisions occurred in the Philly city limits and how many of the resulted in fatalities for the cyclists involved. The available data ranged from 2002-2021.

```

# Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)

We will first begin by loading in the data and preparing it for data analysis.

```{r}

data <- list()

years <- 2002:2021

data_sets <- # Different types of collisions
  c("CRASH",
    "COMMVEH",
    "CYCLE",
    "FLAG",
    "PERSON",
    "ROADWAY",
    "TRAILVEH",
    "VEHICLE")

handle_mismatch <- function(df1, df2) {
  for (colname in colnames(df2)) {
    if (colname %in% colnames(df1)) {
      if (class(df1[[colname]]) != class(df2[[colname]])) {
        df1[[colname]] <- as.character(df1[[colname]])
        df2[[colname]] <- as.character(df2[[colname]])
      }
    }
  }
  return(list(df1, df2))
}

for (data_set in data_sets) {
  absolute_path <- file.path(getwd(), "data", "zip", paste0(data_set, "*"))
  file_path <- Sys.glob(absolute_path)
  
  for (i in seq_along(file_path)) {
    # Load the data set from the CSV file
    new_data <- read.csv(file_path[i], stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    
    # Combine the data
    if (i == 1) {
      data[[tolower(data_set)]] <- new_data
    } else {
      handled_data <- handle_mismatch(data[[tolower(data_set)]], new_data)
      data[[tolower(data_set)]] <-
        bind_rows(handled_data[[1]], handled_data[[2]])
    }
  }
}
```

The collision data from PennDOT for each year is broken into several categories that provide available metadata on the collision. These categories are defined in PennDOT's OpenData metadata PDF that can be accessed in the link above.

To assist in merging the data sets across years, we create a utility function named **`handle_mismatch`**. This function reconciles differences between two data sets of the same category but from different years. For instance, if the `CRASH` data from 2002 and 2003 have columns with the same name but different data types, the function coerces them into the same data type before merging.

The following for-loop calls of the the paths for each of the data sets for each year and binds them all together into one large data frame.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## General EDA

I already have an agenda with exploring these data, but for the sake of curiosity, let's examine some overall trends in the collision data.

```{r}
# Convert your table into a data frame
crash_year_table <- table(data$crash$CRASH_YEAR)
crash_year_df <-
  data.frame(Year = as.integer(names(crash_year_table)),
             Count = as.integer(crash_year_table))

# Create the histogram with a trend line
ggplot(crash_year_df, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              se = FALSE,
              color = "red") +
  labs(x = "Crash Year", y = "Count", title = "Number of Crashes by Year") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Here, we can clearly observer a linear downtrend of the number of collisions per year over the course of the near-20 years of data available. Is this trend significant?

```{r}

lm_result <- lm(Count ~ Year, data = crash_year_df)

p_value <- summary(lm_result)$coefficients[2, 4]
print(p_value)
```

Given that the common cutoff for p-value significance is 0.05, we can confidently claim that this is a significant decline in the number of collisions. This could be due to a variety of factors, and this question is outside of the scope of this analysis, but it does provide valuable context for the rest of our story.

Let's zoom in on our specifically bicycle-related collision data.

## Bicycle-Related Collisions

```{r}
sum(data$crash$BICYCLE_DEATH_COUNT)
# 75 total cyclist deaths over 19 years

data$crash %>%
  group_by(CRASH_YEAR) %>%
  summarise(total_deaths = sum(BICYCLE_DEATH_COUNT, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = CRASH_YEAR, y = total_deaths)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Total Bicycle Deaths per Year in Pennsylvannia",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total Deaths")
```

Here, we observe no readily evident long-term trend; however, there has been a remarkable uptick in bicycle deaths in 2020 and 2021, which fall squarely into the "Pandemic Years." This short-term trend agrees with PennDOT's own findings that [traffic fatalities rose during the pandemic despite less roadway traffic.](https://www.penndot.pa.gov/TravelInPA/Safety/pages/crash-facts-and-statistics.aspx#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20Pennsylvania's%20traffic,%2C%20decreasing%204%25%20to%201%2C179.) The Government Accountability Office also concurs that nationally, [traffic fatalities rose during the COVID-19 lock downs](https://www.gao.gov/blog/during-covid-19-road-fatalities-increased-and-transit-ridership-dipped), which they attribute to potentially riskier driving behavior during these years. Indeed, it may stand to reason that if there are fewer motor vehicles on the road, motorists may engage in riskier driving, which especially puts pedestrians and cyclists in harms way. A New York Times article from 2023 also found [that pedestrian deaths have risen by a staggering 77% from 2010 to 2021.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/pedestrian-deaths-2022.html)

It stands to reason that, if you're a cyclist, you'd want to identify the most dangerous roadways to better understand the risks of cycling and plan commutes that lessen your chances of becoming injured, or worse.

```{r}
cycle_crash_data <- merge(data$crash, data$cycle, by = "CRN")

cycle_crash_data <-
  cycle_crash_data[cycle_crash_data$PC_HLMT_IND != "", ]

cycle_crash_data %>%
  group_by(PC_HLMT_IND) %>%
  summarise(BICYCLE_COUNT = sum(BICYCLE_COUNT, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = PC_HLMT_IND, y = BICYCLE_COUNT)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Total Bicycle-Involed Crashes by Helmet Usage",
       x = "Helmet Usage",
       y = "Total Crashes")
```

Here, we can observe that the vast majority of cyclists involved in a collision were not wearing a helmet at the time of collision. The `U` for "Unknown" code complicates this finding, as they were likely cyclists whose helmet usage was not logged at the time of the incident. Regardless, these data are concerning, given that helmet usage is linked to a [63-88% reduction in in the risk of head, brain and severe brain injury for all ages of bicyclists.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2598379/)

```{r}
cycle_crash_data %>%
  group_by(PC_HLMT_IND) %>%
  summarise(total_deaths = sum(BICYCLE_DEATH_COUNT, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = PC_HLMT_IND, y = total_deaths)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = total_deaths), vjust = -0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Total Bicycle Deaths by Helmet Usage",
       x = "Helmet Usage",
       y = "Total Deaths")
```

Here you can see that by a wide margin, more unhelmeted (`N`) cyclists are killed in collisions than helmeted (`Y`).

```{r}
cycle_crash_data %>%
  group_by(PC_HLMT_IND) %>%
  summarise(
    total_collisions = n(),
    total_deaths = sum(BICYCLE_DEATH_COUNT, na.rm = TRUE),
    death_collision_ratio = total_deaths / total_collisions
  )
```

If we were to take the ratio of deaths to collisions by whether they are wearing helmet, we would observe that unhelmeted cyclists have a higher death-to-collision ratio compared to helmeted cyclists. While a simple ratio isn't alone enough to make any definitive claim and there might be other factors at play, such as environmental conditions, severity of crash, etc., it does make a compelling case for wearing a helmet on the road as a cyclist.

Let's visualize these statistics.

# Visualization

I need to get the county codes for all counties in Pennsylvania because our data table only shows localizes collisions by county code, and not county name. Since we are interested in Philly collision statistics, we need to find the county code for Philly. We're going to do this by scraping a PA government website that displays the county codes in a table, and then we're going to merge in the county code information.

```{r}
# Getting county codes
url <-
  "https://www.revenue.pa.gov/TaxTypes/InheritanceTax/Pages/County%20Codes.aspx"

webpage <- read_html(url)

counties <- html_nodes(webpage, "table") %>% html_table()

counties[[1]][3] <- NULL

counties <- counties[[1]]

counties2 <- counties[, 3:4]
counties <- counties[, 1:2]

counties <- rbind(counties, counties2)
counties <- counties[-68, ]

merged_data <-
  merge(data[["crash"]],
        counties,
        by.x = "COUNTY",
        by.y = "County#",
        all.x = TRUE)

# Replace COUNTY column with County
merged_data$COUNTY <- merged_data$County
merged_data$County <- NULL

head(merged_data$COUNTY)
```

This is when I discovered that whoever produced these collision data tables must have accidentally somehow coded all of these entries as having occurred in York, which is alphabetically the last county in PA. Fortunately, we can restrict all collisions to only those which happen in Philly using `ggmap`.

```{r, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
philly_map <-suppressMessages(
  get_map(
    location = 'Philadelphia',
    zoom = 11,
    maptype = 'roadmap',
    source = 'google'
  ))

philly_ggmap <- ggmap(philly_map)
```

```{r}
data_subset <- data[["crash"]][data[["crash"]]$BICYCLE_COUNT > 0,]

data_subset$BICYCLE_DEATH_COUNT <-
  as.factor(data_subset$BICYCLE_DEATH_COUNT)

data_subset <- merge(data_subset, data[['cycle']], by = "CRN")

data_subset <- data_subset[order(data_subset$BICYCLE_DEATH_COUNT),]
```

We are subsetting the data to only collisions that involved more than zero bicycles.

```{r}
p <-
  philly_ggmap + geom_point(
    data = data_subset,
    aes(x = DEC_LONG, y = DEC_LAT, color = BICYCLE_DEATH_COUNT),
    alpha = .5
  )

# Set the color scale to differentiate between helmeted and non-helmeted fatalities
philly_cycle_crashes <- p + scale_color_manual(values = c("0" = "gray", "1" = "red"))

print(philly_cycle_crashes)
```

Above, we have plotted all cyclist deaths that have occurred in Philadelphia from 2002-2021. Earlier, we noted that there are 75 cyclist deaths that have occurred in Philly during this time range. We can confirm that this total has remained consistent:

```{r}
table(data_subset$BICYCLE_DEATH_COUNT)
```

We can animate this plot to show cyclist deaths by year:\

```{r, warning=FALSE}

# Animate the plot over time
p <- philly_cycle_crashes + transition_time(CRASH_YEAR) +
  labs(title = "Philadelphia Bicyclist Crashes Colored by Whether They Resulted in a Death, 2002-2021\nYear: {frame_time}", color = "How many cyclists died??")

# Display the plot
p <- animate(
  p,
  fps = 1,
  duration = 19,
  height = 800,
  width = 800
)

```

![](images/total_bicycle_crashes.gif)

We can further break down this map by helmet status:

```{r}
data_subset <-
  data[["crash"]][data[["crash"]]$BICYCLE_DEATH_COUNT > 0,]

data_subset <- merge(data_subset, data[['cycle']], by = "CRN")

data_subset[data_subset$PC_HLMT_IND == "", ]$PC_HLMT_IND <- "U"

p <-
  philly_ggmap + geom_point(data = data_subset,
                            aes(x = DEC_LONG, y = DEC_LAT, color = PC_HLMT_IND),
                            alpha = 0.5)

p <-
  p + scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "N" = "red",
    "U" = "blue",
    "Y" = "green"
  ))

print(p + labs(title = "Philadelphia Bicyclist Deaths By Whether They Were Wearing a Helmet, 2002-2021", color = "Were they wearing a helmet?"))
```

We can likewise animate this plot as well:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
p <- p + transition_time(CRASH_YEAR) +
  labs(title = "Philadelphia Bicyclist Deaths By Whether They Were Wearing a Helmet, 2002-2021\nYear: {frame_time}", color = "Were they wearing a helmet?")

# Display the plot
p <- animate(
  p,
  fps = 1,
  duration = 19,
  height = 800,
  width = 800
)
```

![](images/deaths_by_helmet.gif)

Deaths do not give us a complete picture; severe collisions can result in serious injuries, which can be equally, if not more, devastating. To learn more about bicycle-related incidents that resulted in a "serious injury," we can access `BICYCLE_SUSP_SERIOUS_INJ_COUNT`; the PennDOT OpenData Data Dictionary defines "suspected serious injury" as:

> Incapacitating injury, including bleeding wounds and distorted members (amputations or broken bones), and requires transport of the patient from the scene.

```{r}
data_subset <-
  data[["crash"]][data[["crash"]]$BICYCLE_SUSP_SERIOUS_INJ_COUNT > 0,]

data_subset <- merge(data_subset, data[['cycle']], by = "CRN")

data_subset[data_subset$PC_HLMT_IND == "", ]$PC_HLMT_IND <- "U"

# Add the points from your dataset
p <-
  philly_ggmap + geom_point(data = data_subset,
                            aes(x = DEC_LONG, y = DEC_LAT, color = PC_HLMT_IND),
                            alpha = 0.5)

# Set the color scale to differentiate between helmeted and non-helmeted fatalities
p <-
  p + scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "N" = "red",
    "U" = "blue",
    "Y" = "green"
  ))

print(p + labs(title = "Philadelphia Bicyclist Serious Injuries By Whether They Were Wearing a Helmet, 2002-2021", color = "Were they wearing a helmet?"))
```

These maps are interesting, but it's hard to tell which of these streets are the most dangerous from simply looking at them. For that, we will make bar charts to get the top 10 streets by collision and by accident.

```{r}
data_subset <- data[["crash"]][data[["crash"]]$BICYCLE_COUNT > 0,]

data_subset <- merge(data_subset, data[['roadway']], by = "CRN")

# Count accidents and fatalities by street name
street_summary <- data_subset %>%
  group_by(STREET_NAME) %>%
  summarise(
    AccidentCount = n(),
    FatalityCount = sum(BICYCLE_DEATH_COUNT),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Order the data by accident count and fatality count for the respective plots
street_summary_accidents <- street_summary %>%
  arrange(desc(AccidentCount))

street_summary_fatalities <- street_summary %>%
  arrange(desc(FatalityCount))

# Create the plot for accident count
p1 <- ggplot(street_summary_accidents[1:10, ], aes(x = reorder(STREET_NAME, AccidentCount), y = AccidentCount)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Street Name", y = "Number of Accidents", title = "Top 10 Streets by Number of Accidents")

# Create the plot for fatality count
p2 <- ggplot(street_summary_fatalities[1:10, ], aes(x = reorder(STREET_NAME, FatalityCount), y = FatalityCount)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Street Name", y = "Number of Fatalities", title = "Top 10 Streets by Number of Fatalities")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow=2)
```

As a cyclist who has lived in Philly, I've always been wary of certain streets. The data confirms my concerns. Broad and Market St., leading the list of accident-prone areas, don't surprise me. They are major thoroughfares in the city, with Broad St. notably lacking the protective physical barriers for bike lanes that Market St. benefits from.

During my time in Philly, I resided in the Fairmount neighborhood, close to Spring Garden St. -- another hotspot on the list. It serves as a key arterial route with an unprotected bike lane often flanked by fast-moving traffic. Its counterpart in South Philly, Washington Ave., has fortunately seen recent efforts to enhance cyclist safety. But Girard Ave.'s position, topping the fatality list, is concerning. Although it's unexpected, given its inconsistent bike lanes and lack of sturdy protection, the danger it poses to cyclists is, unfortunately, understandable.

These findings lead me to wonder what role gentrification plays in the pedestrianization of city streets. Throughout Philly, transit-rich and pedestrian-friendly areas generally tend to be the ones with greater property values. This reflects the unfortunate reality that street safety can be seen as a privilege, rather than a critical aspect of good infrastructure. A future analysis could break these findings down further by neighborhood to potentially uncover a relationship between street safety, property values, and the rate of neighborhood gentrification. This could provide insights into the prioritization of urban planning and infrastructure improvements based on socio-economic dynamics. I hope this analysis sheds light on the importance of proactively addressing urban cycling safety, and I encourage further explorations into the intersections of urban planning, infrastructure, and societal factors.
