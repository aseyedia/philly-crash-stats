    "text": "As part of my greater effort to branch out of purely bioinformatics-centered R analyses, I took it upon myself to experiment with producing meaningful visualizations on other topics that I am passionate about. To that end, I sought to investigate cyclist collision statistics and examine part of the cost of underfunded bicycle infrastructure.\nAccording to the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia, as of 2017, approximately 17,000 workers bike to work, which represents 2.6% of all workers. Despite this, bicycle infrastructure remains woefully inadequate to meet the needs of commuters and presents a significant obstacle to creating safer roads and reducing carbon emissions. Based on my own experiences, biking in Philly can be treacherous and I have, myself, put myself in harm’s way to travel around the city.\nUsing data sourced from PennDOT’s GIS Open Data Portal, I wanted to examine when and where cyclist collisions occurred in the Philly city limits and how many of the resulted in fatalities for the cyclists involved. The available data ranged from 2002-2021."

    "text": "General EDA\nI already have an agenda with exploring these data, but for the sake of curiosity, let’s examine some overall trends in the collision data.\n\n# Convert your table into a data frame\ncrash_year_table &lt;- table(data$crash$CRASH_YEAR)\ncrash_year_df &lt;-\n  data.frame(Year = as.integer(names(crash_year_table)),\n             Count = as.integer(crash_year_table))\n\n# Create the histogram with a trend line\nggplot(crash_year_df, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\",\n              se = FALSE,\n              color = \"red\") +\n  labs(x = \"Crash Year\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Number of Crashes by Year\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we can clearly observer a linear downtrend of the number of collisions per year over the course of the near-20 years of data available. Is this trend significant?\n\nlm_result &lt;- lm(Count ~ Year, data = crash_year_df)\n\np_value &lt;- summary(lm_result)$coefficients[2, 4]\nprint(p_value)\n\n[1] 0.001133501\n\n\nGiven that the common cutoff for p-value significance is 0.05, we can confidently claim that this is a significant decline in the number of collisions. This could be due to a variety of factors, and this question is outside of the scope of this analysis, but it does provide valuable context for the rest of our story.\nLet’s zoom in on our specifically bicycle-related collision data."

The Government Accountability Office also concurs that nationally, traffic fatalities rose during the COVID-19 lock downs, which they attribute to potentially riskier driving behavior during these years. Indeed, it may stand to reason that if there are fewer motor vehicles on the road, motorists may engage in riskier driving, which especially puts pedestrians and cyclists in harms way. A New York Times article from 2023 also found that pedestrian deaths have risen by a staggering 77% from 2010 to 2021.\nIt stands to reason that, if you’re a cyclist, you’d want to identify the most dangerous roadways to better understand the risks of cycling and plan commutes that lessen your chances of becoming injured, or worse.\n\ncycle_crash_data &lt;- merge(data$crash, data$cycle, by = \"CRN\")\n\ncycle_crash_data &lt;-\n  cycle_crash_data[cycle_crash_data$PC_HLMT_IND != \"\", ]\n\ncycle_crash_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(PC_HLMT_IND) %&gt;%\n  summarise(BICYCLE_COUNT = sum(BICYCLE_COUNT, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = PC_HLMT_IND, y = BICYCLE_COUNT)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Total Bicycle-Involed Crashes by Helmet Usage\",\n       x = \"Helmet Usage\",\n       y = \"Total Crashes\")\n\n\n\n\nHere, we can observe that the vast majority of cyclists involved in a collision were not wearing a helmet at the time of collision. The U for “Unknown” code complicates this finding, as they were likely cyclists whose helmet usage was not logged at the time of the incident. Regardless, these data are concerning, given that helmet usage is linked to a 63-88% reduction in in the risk of head, brain and severe brain injury for all ages of bicyclists.\n\ncycle_crash_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(PC_HLMT_IND) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_deaths = sum(BICYCLE_DEATH_COUNT, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = PC_HLMT_IND, y = total_deaths)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = total_deaths), vjust = -0.5) + \n  labs(title = \"Total Bicycle Deaths by Helmet Usage\",\n       x = \"Helmet Usage\",\n       y = \"Total Deaths\")\n\n\n\n\nHere you can see that by a wide margin, more unhelmeted (N) cyclists are killed in collisions than helmeted (Y).\n\ncycle_crash_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(PC_HLMT_IND) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    total_collisions = n(),\n    total_deaths = sum(BICYCLE_DEATH_COUNT, na.rm = TRUE),\n    death_collision_ratio = total_deaths / total_collisions\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  PC_HLMT_IND total_collisions total_deaths death_collision_ratio\n  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;int&gt;        &lt;int&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 N                       4868           45               0.00924\n2 U                       3360           26               0.00774\n3 Y                        813            3               0.00369\n\n\nIf we were to take the ratio of deaths to collisions by whether they are wearing helmet, we would observe that unhelmeted cyclists have a higher death-to-collision ratio compared to helmeted cyclists. While a simple ratio isn’t alone enough to make any definitive claim and there might be other factors at play, such as environmental conditions, severity of crash, etc., it does make a compelling case for wearing a helmet on the road as a cyclist.\nLet’s visualize these statistics."
